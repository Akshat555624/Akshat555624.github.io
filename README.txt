This is my portfolio website designed using an HTML5UP template


This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation tested) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). I have used this template frm HTML5UP and changed it according to my needs respectively
